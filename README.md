# Predicting-Absenteeism

A large problem within organisations is how to motivate their employees. In fact, the next sessions will be dedicated to the study of motivation. As we have seen, traditional approaches to understanding motivation through evaluation are fraught with subjectivities. Newer approaches that leverage instant messaging and online technologies have recently tried to identify issues such as motivation or reasons for absenteeism within the workforce. 

In this assignment, you will use data available from HappyForce in order to assess employment absenteeism.

Please go to the following website and use all the files within the employee absenteeism dataset:

﻿HappyForce dataset﻿

The objectives of this assignment are to:

Develop machine learning to predict absenteeism
Analyse which features are likely to predict absenteeism
Build categories for different types of employees; these categories should be related to their motivation
Discuss what actions can be taken within an organisation to avoid absenteeism.
You may use whichever methods of coding you would like. 

Please find below a sample script in terms of coding which gives an initial idea for what is needed for this assignment.
